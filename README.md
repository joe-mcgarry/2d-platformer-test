# Monster Chase - a 2D monster jumping game

In an attempt to learn some C# and Unity, I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo) tutorial to make a simple 2D game where the player has to jump to avoid the monsters, which spawn at the left and right hand side at random of the screen and move towards the opposite side of the screen at a random speed.
If the player fails to jump over the monsters, the player vanishes from the screen. 
There is a restart button which spawns the player back when pressed, as well as a home button to return to the menu.
